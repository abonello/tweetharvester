After adding all the code necessary to look for tweets and extract various parts, 
now I am going to add code to analyse the Lexical diversity of the returned tweets.  
  
## Lexical Diversity
Lexical diversity is a measure of how many unique words are used in a text. It can be be used in interpersonal communication in determining how rich or otherwise someoneâ€™s use of language is. It can also be used in social media to determine how broadly a topic is being discussed.

## Tweet Popularity
This will cover the following:
 1. Determine how popular a tweet is by counting its number of retweets.
 2. Set a retweet threshold value that ignores retweets below a certain number.
 3. Prettify the results by listing the text of the popular tweets alongside its retweet,  
    and order the list by popularity.
